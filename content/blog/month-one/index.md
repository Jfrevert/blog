It's been about two months and I have not dedicated as much time as I expected towards learning and practicing ML. I completed the Google Intro to Tensorflow course around mid-January, and felt like I got a lot of benefit out of it. Since then, I've been working on Andrew NG's course. I can't lie, I got stuck on the Math things a few times, but just got through the last time I was on, which was Tuesday of this week.

I've reduced to going online maybe 2-3 times a week. I blame some more work things coming up recent weeks. 

In other news, I started this site last night. I had been sitting on this domain for a while, and then felt inspired to create a personal/blog site. I started with Hexo, and ended up going up with Gatsby.js. Currently, it's just a static-site deployed on S3, with no plans to change anytime soon.
