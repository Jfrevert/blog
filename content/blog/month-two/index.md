Well. My progress with my self-learning curriculum slowed to a crawl this past month. I continuued with Andrew Ng's machine learning course, but think I logged into Coursera maybe three times throughout the month.  

I only made significant progress today, the first of March. Today, Andrew started going over feature scaling and mean normalization. A lot of it didn't totally make sense until some more context was added with a real-estate example. 

In other news, I think I've found a study buddy at work. One of my co-workers who I've worked really closely with for about two years now - the entirety of my time at this job. I'm pretty pumped about this because we're going to spend two hours a week just sitting down and studying/coding machine learning stuff together ðŸ’». 

I'm hoping that soon I'll have tangible stuff to show and add to the blog. For now, Andrew Ng's stuff is focused on the math fundamentals of machine learning, so it may be a while before I can share cool stuff. For now though, I just need to suck it up and keep making the time to study.
