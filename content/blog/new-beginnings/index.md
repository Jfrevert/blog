Hello World!
Well it's already January 7th and I have been steady going on my new year's resolutions. One of those is to identify and tackle a new technical skillset that I can use to solve major problems. So far, I've identified one, Machine Learning, and have told myself that I will: 

a. Take a course

b. Practice (just about) everyday.

I want to have a formal introduction to what this blog will be, that post will come later. For now, I want to talk about what I worked on last night. 

 

To give some background, I have been taking Google's Intro to Tensorflow course on Udacity. Last night was the first night where the course challenged me to write my own code to download a dataset, create a model, and then improve its accuracy. I felt successful in that I could write a fair amount of it on my own (especially except for things that I would know way have remembered, like the crossentropy function, and names of methods I had to look up), and still felt challenged. The python syntax is still pretty new to me, hoping to pick up more as time goes on! Here it is! It was pretty cool because the model is made to classify flowers. It's pretty cool to try out machine learning as someone who the world of software development, where coding something that could classify objects in pictures would be unheard of.
